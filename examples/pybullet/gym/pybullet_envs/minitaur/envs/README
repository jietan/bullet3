This folder contains a number of simulated Minitaur environments implemented using pybullet.
The following two environments are used in the RSS paper "Sim-to-Real: Learning Agile Locomotion For Quadruped Robots":
1) Galloping example: minitaur_reactive_env.py
python minitaur_reactive_env_example.py runs a pre-trained PPO agent that performs galloping gait.

2) Trotting example: minitaur_trotting_env.py
python minitaur_trotting_env_example.py runs a pre-trained PPO agent that performs trotting gait.

The rest are experimental environments.
